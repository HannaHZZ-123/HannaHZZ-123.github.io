# Teachings

- I served as a teaching assistant of [CS 5610/6610 Interactive Computer Graphics, 2024 Spring](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2024/). During the course, I was responsible for answering questions in the Q&A session every week and grading part of the assignments.
- I help organize a semester-long [Computer Graphics Seminar](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs7933/spring2024/) in 2024 Spring. During the seminar, I was responsible to host the weekly meeting.
