The solution manuals and notes are updated [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JniBrBWQhSJGFxVcg8VjN6QZPcWo4tVc?usp=sharing).

## Timeline

* 01/15/2025: I took a break after the application season and was back to work when 2025 Spring began at Jan. 6th. I take algebraic topology and modern algebra II this semester. Since I am funded by TA instead of RA at my department, I had more time for math in the next few months. For the first week, I completed the notes regarding algebraic varieties and their generalization to prime spectrums, roughly corresponding to Chapter 2, 4, 6 of Fulton, Chapter 1 of Hartshorne and Exercises of Chapter 1 of Atiyah.
* 12/15/2024: Upload the solution manual for Atiyah-MacDonald and Fulton's book. Upload notes for Modern Algebra I, which includes basic category theory and commutative algebra (no more than the first two chapters of Atiyah-MacDonald).
