# [About](/#About)

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, doing research in physics-based simulation. However, due to my shift of interest and my long-term enthusiasm about mathematics, I decided to quit and persue a Ph.D. in pure mathematics instead. The detailed reasons for this decision can be found in [this](/2024/11/26/QA) Q&A-style post.

During my undergraduate years, I have completed 30+ credits from the math department, excluding the compulsary courses for engineering student.
