# About

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, doing research in physics-based simulation, which lies at the intersection between computer science and computational mathematics. However, after one year of research work, I realized that I am more interested in the mathematics behind the application than the application itself. So I decided to quit and pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics instead.
